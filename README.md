# Node js Authentication System

## A rest api for authentication with number and otp(one time password)
I show in this video a Authentication System with OTP-One time password by using node js, express js, bcrypt, jwt, and creating by Restful API. This is completely a backend build. This is actually signup and login system. The database I used in this build is MongoDB. Watch full video to better understanding. Comment out what new things would you want in my channel.
